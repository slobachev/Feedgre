# Feedgre
Web API to consume aggregated RSS, Atom feeds

This is my implementation of popular service https://feedly.com/ presented yet as a WEB API 
written in ASP.NET Core using thrird-parties like Restsharp, sqlite and Entity Framework Core for persistence,
xUnit for testing, Newtonsoft for serialization and Auth0 for a base authentication and autorisation. 
It is also worth mentioning implementation of in-memory caching and logging.
